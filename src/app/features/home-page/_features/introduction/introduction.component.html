    This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows
    that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once
    considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific debate about
    how to best describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The
    most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International
    Astronomical Union in 2006.

      This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone
      knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres
      were once considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific
      debate about how to best describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to
      this day. The most recent definition of a planet was adopted by the
      International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three
      things:
      <ul>
        <li>It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</li>
        <li>
          It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a
          spherical shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects
          of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.
        </li>
      </ul>
